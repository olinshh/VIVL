### Real-Time Fraud Intelligence Layer

**VIVL** is an AI-powered fraud intelligence layer for banks and financial services. It integrates into transaction processing as a decision-support system that scores risk in real time, produces **explainable decisions** (APPROVE / REVIEW / BLOCK), and generates **investigation case files** when needed.

**What it does**
- Ingests live or simulated transaction streams
- Combines a trained LLM with historical context for risk analysis
- Outputs decisions with an auditable rationale
- Creates full investigation packs for REVIEW/BLOCK cases
- Maintains an append-only audit log for compliance

VIVL does **not** replace a bank’s core payments stack; it adds an intelligence layer that reduces manual work, speeds investigations, and improves auditability.
